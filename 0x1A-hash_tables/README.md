A hash table in C is a data structure that maps keys to values.
A hash table uses a hash function to compute indexes for a key.
You can store the value at the appropriate location based on the hash table index.

The benefit of using a hash table is its very fast access time.
Typically, the time complexity (amortized time complexity) is a constant O(1) access time.

If two different keys get the same index,
you will need to use other data structures (buckets) to account for these collisions.
If you choose a very good hash function, the likelihood of a collision can be negligible.
